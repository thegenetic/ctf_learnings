1. First did a port scan and found only port 80 is open
2. Then did directory enum and found out an endpoint '/webdav' which had a login interface which had default creds.
3. Then found out i can upload files and can access them. So uploaded a shell and got a revershell.
4. and then executed linpeas to find if i could find an exploit(no luck)
5. then in the sudoers file i saw this
User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat

it means i can read any file using the cat command.
6. then i directly read the flag file i.e. `sudo /bin/cat /root/root.txt`

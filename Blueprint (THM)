Learned about NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) - stores all the local user's hashes, SMB (Server Message Block)

1. First found out the open ports and i found out a lot's of em open.
2. Then i found port 80 is not rechable then accessed a directory using port 8080 which had an ecommerce store (which was also vulnerable and found a cve on researching a bit).
3. Then i saw a reverse shell poc on that particular CMS.
4. Then i've searched the name of that particular store on searchsploit and found that it has a python code which gives me a reverse shell.
5. Then after successfulling gaining the shell i got into a windows server. From ther i submitted the root flag. Then went looking for the NTLM hash value.
6. It was unknown to me then after researching i still couldn't figure out some missing parts to how to get the hash and then got an article which says the following about it:
  - These hashes are called windows hashes. In this window stores it password on the machine itself
  - To learn a bit more about it reffer to this article (https://aas-s3curity.gitbook.io/cheatsheet/internalpentest/active-directory/post-exploitation/extracting-credentials/retrieve-windows-hashes)
  - After that by copying the SAM(Security Account Manager) hive i.e. the SAM data base which include SAM, SYSTEM, SECURITY files (process is mentioned in the above article) 
using the reg.exe (Read, Set or Delete registry keys and values, save and restore from a .REG file).
  - then afterreciving the hash craced it with crackstation and submitted the other flag.
